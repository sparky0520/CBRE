GitHub co-pilot use cases:

Parameters: Code Base Condition, Features

Other factors affecting the efficiency of adding of features : Developer skills and tools (familiarity, copilot efficiency) , technological considerations (compatibility, performance)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using GitHub Copilot to Add Features:

Pros:
- Faster implementation for small to moderate enhancements.
- Leveraging existing infrastructure and user familiarity.
- Reduced initial costs compared to building a new app.
Cons:
- Potentially increasing technical debt.
- Limited by the existing architecture and technology stack.

Building a New Application:

Pros:
- Opportunity to use modern technologies and best practices.
- Cleaner architecture, easier future maintenance.
- Potentially better performance and scalability.
Cons:
- Higher initial costs and longer development time.
- Need for data migration and user transition planning.

--- Three things to consider :
	
	1. Features needed: If the features needed are simple then integrating them to the legacy app should be considered (using co-pilot). But if the features are complex and big, then a complete overhaul may be needed (make a new app from scratch).

	2. Condition of Legacy Code Base: If the code base is not well maintained then it may be better to make a new app. Only a well-maintained code base will benefit from GitHub copilot.

	3. Future Needs: Future needs like scalability and updates should also be considered as making a new app will result in newer and more efficient technology being used. This will help in making a more scalable app while leaving potential for more feature additions.
 	
	Other ways could be:
	
	1. Hybrid: To avoid reimplementing the entire existing code we can make microservices of core functionality and overhaul the rest of the app as needed.
