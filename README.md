 All tasks done during internship at CBRE.

## BSE NEWSLETTER BOT

- Made this as my final project at my training at CBRE, Gurugram.
- Newsletter bot will scrape the bseindia.com website for corporate announcements relating to bonuses or dividends by companies on that specific day.
- It will summarise the attached pdf files using Gemini 1.5 Flash and send a neat newsletter.
- To counter the access blocker (rate limiter), it will scan the website at pseudo random intervals.
