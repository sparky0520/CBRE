Changes made to BSE Newsletter Project:

1. Increasing Robustness: 

Using name to get PageElement in BeautifulSoup instead of id where name is unique to that element and id is not (submit button)

Checked and implemented type conversions whereever needed

	Considered xpath also but 
		- using properties such as (id, name) where more readable, maintainable and fast because of beautiful soup.
		- If html structure changes - xpath (full xpath) will break, if property values (id,name) are changed then that will break, if xpath(relative) is used then changing anything will break.

2. Tried to implement: Click all Read More.. anchor tags but some server side error is hindering (sv is not defined).

3. Used filter method in dividend_or_bonus_filter() function.
